## 1. Introduction to Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed line by line.

**Key Features:**
- **Readable and Maintainable Code:** Python's syntax emphasizes readability.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Variables do not need explicit declaration.
- **Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line.
- **Comprehensive Standard Library:** Extensive libraries and modules to perform many tasks.
- **Portability:** Python programs can run on various platforms without modification.
- **Open Source:** Python is free to use and distribute, including for commercial purposes.

## 2. Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Basic Syntax

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a string to the console
```

- **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- **Variables:** No need to declare; created upon assignment.

```python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
```

### Data Types

- **Numbers:** int, float, complex

```python
a = 10        # int
b = 3.14      # float
c = 1 + 2j    # complex
```

- **String:** Immutable sequences of characters

```python
s = "Hello, World!"
print(s[0])   # H
print(s[7:12]) # World
```

- **List:** Ordered, mutable collections

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, "Python"]
lst.append(4)
print(lst)   # [1, 2, 3, 'Python', 4]
```

- **Tuple:** Ordered, immutable collections

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3)
print(tup[1]) # 2
```

- **Set:** Unordered collections of unique elements

```python
s = {1, 2, 3, 4}
s.add(5)
print(s) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

- **Dictionary:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs

```python
d = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(d["name"]) # Alice
```

## 3. Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

```python
x = 10
if x < 0:
    print("Negative")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Positive")
```

### Loops

- **for loop:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

- **while loop:**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## 4. Functions

### Defining and Calling Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### Lambda Functions

```python
square = lambda x: x * 2
print(square(5))
```

## 5. Modules and Packages

### Importing Modules

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
```

### Creating a Module

Save the following code in a file named `mymodule.py`:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Then import and use the module:

```python
import mymodule
print(mymodule.add(5, 3))
```

## 6. Data Structures

### List Comprehensions

```python
squares = [x * 2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```

### Dictionary Comprehensions

```python
squares = {x: x * 2 for x in range(5)}
print(squares)
```

## 7. File Handling

### Reading a File

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

### Writing to a File

```python
with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(dog.bark())
```

### Inheritance

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Cat(Animal):
    def meow(self):
        return f"{self.name} says meow!"

cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(cat.meow())
```

## 9. Exception Handling

### Try-Except Block

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed")
```

## 10. Advanced Topics

### Decorators

```python
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function():
        print("Wrapper executed this before {}".format(original_function.__name__))
        return original_function()
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def display():
    print("Display function ran")

display()
```

### Generators

```python
def generator_function():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

gen = generator_function()
print(next(gen)) # 0
print(next(gen)) # 1
```

### Context Managers

```python
class OpenFile:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file.close()

with OpenFile('sample.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Testing')
```

## 11. Libraries and Frameworks

### Popular Libraries

- **NumPy:** Numerical computing
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib:** Plotting and visualization
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Deep learning

### Popular Frameworks

- **Django:** Web development
- **Flask:** Lightweight web framework
- **FastAPI:** Modern, fast web framework for building APIs

## 12. Best Practices

- **Follow PEP 8:** Python's style guide.
- **Write Readable Code:** Use meaningful variable names and comments.
- **Modularize Code:** Use functions and classes to organize code.
- **Handle Exceptions:** Gracefully handle errors using try-except blocks.
- **Test Code:** Write tests to ensure your code works as expected.
